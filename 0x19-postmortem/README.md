Root Cause.
In the afternoon there is a strong gale accompanied by heavy rains that in the area caused great problems not only in the city's public wiring but also in the private infrastructure of different companies in this area. During the first 20 minutes of the start of the gale at approximately 4:45 pm 04/22/2020, it was believed that it was only an energy problem and that it would be solved with the operation of the company's physical energy generating plants, and after 25 minutes the server was restarted automatically as it did not have an active state (OK), this process ended, we checked to see if we had a local problem but several attempts to restart and manual configuration did not give results. At that time we asked third parties if any news had been reported outside the company and that it affected it, the answer was that if there was damage in the surroundings of the company and it was then when we learned that the cause was completely unrelated to the possibilities to restore the service internally.

Resolution and Recovery
Once it was determined that the cause was external, the corresponding reports were made to the external company in charge of solving these technical problems regarding its physical infrastructure, after 25 minutes from the initial report until the arrival of the external company providing the service. of wiring, it was possible to reestablish the operation of the server.

Corrective and preventive measures
A prevention scheme was carried out that determined that a system of wired connections to the exterior should be implemented below ground to avoid this type of problem when an environmental disaster such as the one that occurred again occurs.
